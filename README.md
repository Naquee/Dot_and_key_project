# Dot_and_key_project

Hello Readers,


I hope all of you are doing good and safe. I am happy to share with you all that I created our first project Key and Dots in Construct Week Project. This blog is all about our journey and the challenges we faced while building the project. We build this website in just 3 days and one more day for preparing for the presentation and documentation.
